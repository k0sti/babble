# Test configuration for test action wiring validation
#
# This test validates that all test actions from CONCURRENT-A2 are properly
# wired and execute without errors:
# - send_text: logs the text and warns about orchestrator
# - stop_generation: logs and warns about orchestrator
# - snapshot: captures screenshot to output/<name>.png
# - report_success: logs success
# - report_failure: logs failure and sets test_failed flag
#
# Note: send_text and stop_generation are not yet wired to orchestrator
# (tracked in follow-up task), but they should execute without crashing.
